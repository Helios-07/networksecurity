### ðŸ“Š Experiment Tracking & Versioning
We use MLflow for tracking experiments and DagsHub for versioning our code and data, and for comparing results.

## Single Experiment Run
Here is a view of a single experiment's details and metrics tracked in MLflow.

## Comparing Experiments
DagsHub provides a powerful interface to compare different experiment runs side-by-side, helping us select the best-performing model.
